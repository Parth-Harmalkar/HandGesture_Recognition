# HandGesture_Recognition
This Notebook demonstrates a comprehensive approach to hand gesture recognition using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures, which can be utilized in applications such as human-computer interaction, sign language translation, and more.


Features

    Data Collection: Instructions and methods for collecting hand gesture images or video data.
    Data Preprocessing: Techniques for preprocessing the data, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
    Model Selection: Exploration of different machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for gesture recognition.
    Training and Validation: Training the selected model with annotated data and validating its performance using various metrics.
    Real-time Prediction: Implementation of real-time gesture recognition using a webcam or video input.
    Visualization: Visualization of model performance, including accuracy and loss curves, and sample predictions.
